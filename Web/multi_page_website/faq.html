                    Shipping
                    <ul>
                        <li>To where do you ship? How long does it take you to process an order before it is dispatched?</li>
                        <li>Where are your packages shipped from?</li>
                        <li>Do you ship packages internationally?</li>

                            Tracking (We&#8217;ll use Australia Post as an example, but you can use any shipping carrier like Canada Post, USPS, FedEx, UPS, etc.).

                                    What does &#8220;In-transit&#8221; mean for Australia Post tracking?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Something you may want to cover for your customers is that &#8220;In-transit&#8221; means that you have dispatched the goods to your postal office, and that they are travelling to the destination postal dispatch centre or post office, where a local driver or delivery person will be picking them up.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    What does &#8220;No Events Found&#8221; mean for Australia Post tracking?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>You&#8217;ll need to tell them that this is normal and that some packages show nothing on the tracking number lookup until they get to the destination post office or postal centre near the delivery point. Many Parcel Post Plus and even Express Packages going outside the Australia Post delivery network will show as &#8220;No Events Found&#8221; until the day they are going to be delivered. The customer can sometimes be able to contact Australia Post for more information.</li>
