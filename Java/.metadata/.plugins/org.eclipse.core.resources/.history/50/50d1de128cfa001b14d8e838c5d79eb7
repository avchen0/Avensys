	<!-- Setter Injection 
		Note that if we specify to Spring that we want it to create a bean via
		Setter Injection, in our class, (in this case com.injection.setter.Worker),
		we cannot have a Constructor because if we have a Constructor then Spring
		will try to instantiate a bean via Constructor Injection and so it will
		look for the xml configuration for Constructor Injection (i.e. the
		constructor-arg tags). This is why a constructor was not defined in the 
		Worker class.
		
		This error does not happen if we have defined setters in our class and
		told Spring to get our beans via Constructor Injection, which is what we
		did in MyAppOne.
		
		In MyAppOne, we told Spring to give us a bean and in our XML file we only
		told it how to create the bean using Constructor Injection. Even though we
		have setters in the Employee class, it will try to perform Constructor
		Injection 1st before performing Setter Injection.
